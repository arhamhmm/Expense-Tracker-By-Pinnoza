# ðŸŽ¯ FINAL TEST GUIDE - Project Entries

## âœ… **All Issues Fixed!**

I've removed **all** the restrictions that were preventing demo users from adding project entries:

### ðŸ”§ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Add Entry Buttons**: âœ… No longer disabled for demo users
2. **Form Fields**: âœ… All inputs (date, description, amount, currency) are now editable
3. **Submit Button**: âœ… Works for both demo and real users
4. **Edit/Delete Buttons**: âœ… Enabled for demo users
5. **Demo Warning**: âœ… Removed confusing "operations disabled" message
